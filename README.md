# TGS-Lymphoma-Classification
This project focuses on lymphoma classification using an ensemble deep learning approach. The model combines the strengths of four backbone architectures:
- ResNet-50
- DenseNet-121
- Vision Transformer (ViT-B)
- Swin Transformer (Swin-B)

By leveraging both CNN-based and Transformer-based feature extractors, the ensemble achieves robust performance for medical image classification tasks.
